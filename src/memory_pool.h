/**
  The memory pool is a memory container designed for concurrent access and
  it contains:
  - A vector of pre-allocated heap memory (bins).
  - Each bin will be of the initially provided bin size.
  - A stack containing the indexes of the available bins from the vector.
  - A fetchBlock() operation gets an available resource and returns the index
    to the acquired bin, removes the index entry from the stack.
  - A returnBlock() operation requeues the provided index back into the stack,
    thereby making the bin pointed to by the index available again.
